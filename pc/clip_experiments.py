"""Run experiments (GloVe, Dep-Embs, ELMo).

This actually does the final train-and-test runs of the above models. (Note that Bert is
run separately in bert.py as it is fine-tuned end-to-end.)

Cross validation is performed in models.py; there are extensive comments there about the
hyperparameters.
